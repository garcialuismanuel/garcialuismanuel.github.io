Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself.
```
I was born and raised in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex before moving down to Austin to study Math at UT Austin. Received my BS in Math and then while searching for MS Statistics programs, I discovered MS Data Science programs. Am currently set to graduate from SMU's MSDS program in May 2024. Currently working as a Business Analyst and looking to continue my education later in life in order to deepen my knowledge of Statistics.
