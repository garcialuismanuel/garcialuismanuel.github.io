I was born and raised in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex before moving to Austin to pursue a B.S in Math from UT Austin. Upon receiving my B.S in Math on 2017, I began searching for graduate courses in Statistics as I enjoyed the Probability/Statistics courses the most and in doing so I discovered SMU's M.S of Data Science program. It was a good blend of Statistics and Computer Science so I enrolled and upon graduating on May 2024, I moved to New York. I now seek an opportunity to put the programming, communication, and analysis skills I learned to use in a work setting!
